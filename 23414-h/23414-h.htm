      In travelling about the world one collects a number of those trifles of
      all sorts, usually named &ldquo;curiosities,&rdquo; many of them worthless if it were
      not for the memories they recall. The other day I was clearing out a
      bureau before going abroad, and in one of the drawers I came across a
      hedgehog&rsquo;s foot, set in silver, and hung upon a tarnished silver chain. I
      picked it up in the Sahara, and here is its history.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mohammed El Aïd Ben Ali Tidjani, marabout of Tamacine, is a great man in
      the Sahara Desert. His reputation for piety reaches as far as Tunis and
      Algiers, to the north of Africa, and to the uttermost parts of the
      Southern Desert, even to the land of the Touaregs. He dwells in a sacred
      village of dried mud and brick, surrounded by a high wall, pierced with
      loopholes, and ornamented with gates made of palm wood, and covered with
      sheets of iron. In his mansion, above the entrance of which is written
      &ldquo;L&rsquo;Entrée de Sidi Laïd,&rdquo; are clocks innumerable, musical boxes, tables,
      chairs, sofas, and even framed photographs. Negro servants bow before him,
      wives, brothers, children, and obsequious hangers-on of various
      nationalities, black, bronze, and <i>café au lait</i> in colour, offer him
      perpetual incense. Rich worshippers of the Prophet and the Prophet&rsquo;s
      priests send him presents from afar; camels laden with barley, donkeys
      staggering beneath sacks of grain, ostrich plumes, silver ornaments,
      perfumes, red-eyed doves, gazelles whose tiny hoofs are decorated with
      gold-leaf or painted in bright colours. The tributes laid before the tomb
      of Cheikh Sidi El Hadj Ali ben Sidi El Hadj Aïssa are, doubtless, his
      perquisites as guardian of the saint. He dresses in silks of the tints of
      the autumn leaf, and carries in his mighty hand a staff hung with
      apple-green ribbons. And his smile is as the smile of the rising sun in an
      oleograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      This personage one day blessed the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot I at present possess,
      and endowed it solemnly with miraculous curative properties. It would
      cure, he declared, all the physical ills that can beset a woman. Then he
      gave it into the hands of a great Agha, who was about to take a wife,
      accepted a tribute of dates, a grandfather&rsquo;s clock from Paris, and a
      grinding organ of Barbary as a small acknowledgment of his generosity, and
      probably thought very little more about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the course of time, it happened that the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot came into
      the possession of a dancing-girl of Touggourt, called Halima. How Halima
      got hold of it I cannot say, nor does anyone in Touggourt exactly know, so
      far as I am aware. But, alas! even Aghas are sometimes human, and play
      pitch and toss with magical things. As Grand Dukes who go to disport
      themselves in Paris sometimes hie them incognito to the &ldquo;Café de la
      Sorcière,&rdquo; so do Aghas flit occasionally to Touggourt, and appear upon the
      high benches of the great dancing-house of the Ouled Nails in the
      outskirts of the city. And Halima was young and beautiful. Her eyes were
      large, and she wore a golden crown ornamented with very tall feathers. And
      she danced the dance of the hands and the dance of the fainting fit with
      great perfection. And the wives of Aghas have to put up with a good deal.
      However it was, one evening Halima danced with the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot that
      had been blessed dangling from her jewelled girdle. And there was a great
      scandal in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the four quarters of Touggourt, the quarter of the Jews, of the
      foreigners, of the freed negroes, and of the citizens proper, it was known
      that the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot had been blessed and endowed with magical powers
      by the mighty marabout of Tamacine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halima herself affirmed it, standing at the front door of her terraced
      dwelling in the court, while the other dancers gathered round, looking
      like a troop of macaws in their feathers and their finery. With a brazen
      pride she boasted that she possessed something worth more than uncut
      rubies, carpets from Bagdad, and silken petticoats sewn with sequins. And
      the Ouled Naïls could not gainsay her. Indeed, they turned their huge,
      kohl-tinted eyes upon the relic with envy, and stretched their painted
      hands towards it as if to a god in prayer. But Halima would let no one
      touch it, and presently, taking from her bosom her immense door key, she
      retired to enshrine the foot in her box, studded with huge brass nails,
      such as stands by each dancer&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the scandal was very great in the city that such a precious thing
      should be between the hands of an Ouled Naïl, a girl of no repute, come
      thither in a palanquin on camel-back to earn her dowry, and who would
      depart into the sands of the south, laden with the gold wrung from the
      pockets of loose livers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Ben-Abid smiled gently when he heard of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben-Abid belonged to the <i>Tribu des blancs</i>, and was the singer
      attached to the café of the smokers of the hashish. He it was who struck
      each evening a guitar made of goatskin backed by sand tortoise, and lifted
      up his voice in the song &ldquo;Lalia&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Ladham Pacha who has left the heart of his enemies
      trembling&mdash;
         O Lalia! O Lalia!
   The love of women is no more sweet to me after thy love.

   Thy hand is white, and thy bracelets are of the purest
      silver&mdash;
   And I, Ladham Pacha, love thee, without thought of
      what will come.
         O Lalia! O Lalia!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The assembled smokers breathed out under the black ceiling their deep
      refrain of &ldquo;Wur-ra-Wurra!&rdquo; and Larbi, in his Zouave jacket and his tight,
      pleated skirt, threw back his small head, exposing his long brown throat,
      and danced like a tired phantom in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben-Abid smiled, showing two rows of lustrous teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should Halima fall ill, the foot will not avail to cure her,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;Ben Ali Tidjani&rsquo;s blessing could never rest on an Ouled Naïl,
      who, like a little viper of the sand, has stolen into the Agha&rsquo;s bosom,
      and filled his veins with subtle poison. She deems she has a treasure; but
      let her beware: that which would protect a woman who wears the veil will
      do naught for a creature who shows her face to the stranger, and dances by
      night for the Zouaves and for the Spahis who patrol the dunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he struck his long fingers upon the goatskin of his instrument, while
      Kouïdah, the boy who played upon the little glasses and shook the
      tambourine of reeds, slipped forth to tell in the city what Ben-Abid had
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halima was enraged when she heard of it, more especially as there were
      found many to believe Ben-Abid&rsquo;s words. She stood before her room upon the
      terrace, where Zouaves were playing cards with the dancers in the sun, and
      she cursed him in a shrill voice, calling him son of a scorpion, and
      requesting that Allah would send great troubles upon his relations, even
      upon his aged grandmother. That the miraculous reputation of her treasure
      should be thus scouted, and herself insulted, vexed her to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the son of a camel with a swollen tongue dare to come to me and
      repeat what he has said!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Let him come out from his lair in
      the café of the hashish smokers, and, as Allah is great, I will spit in
      his face. The reviler of women! The son of a scorpion! Cursed be his&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then once more she desired evil to the grandmother of Ben-Abid, and to
      all his family. And the Zouaves and the dancers laughed over their card
      games. Indeed, the other dancers were merry, and not ill-pleased with
      Ben-Abid&rsquo;s words. For even in the Sahara the women do not care that one of
      them should be exalted above the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in Touggourt gossip is carried from house to house, as the sand
      grains are carried on the wind. Within an hour Ben-Abid heard that his
      grandmother had been cursed, and himself called son of a scorpion, by
      Halima. Kouïdah, the boy, ran on naked feet to tell him in the café of the
      hashish smokers. When he heard he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night I will go to the dancing-house, and speak with Halima,&rdquo; he
      murmured. And then he plucked the guitar of goatskin that was ever in his
      hands, and sang softly of the joys of Ladham Pacha, half closing his eyes,
      and swaying his head from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kouïdah, the boy, ran back across the camel market to tell in the
      court of the dancers the words of Ben-Abid.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when the nomads lit their brushwood fires in the market; when
      the Kabyle bakers, in their striped turbans and their close-fitting
      jerseys of yellow and of red, ran to and fro bearing the trays of flat,
      new-made loaves; when the dwarfs beat on the ground with their staffs to
      summon the mob to watch their antics; and the story-tellers put on their
      glasses, and sat them down at their boards between the candles; Ben-Abid
      went forth secretly from the hashish café wrapped in his burnous. He
      sought out in the quarter of the freed negroes a certain man called Sadok,
      who dwelt alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Sadok was lean as a spectre, and had a skin like parchment. He was a
      renowned plunger in desert wells, and could remain beneath the water, men
      said, for a space of four minutes. But he could also do another thing. He
      could eat scorpions. And this he would do for a small sum of money. Only,
      during the fast of Ramadan, between the rising and the going down of the
      sun, so long as a white thread could be distinguished from a black, he
      would not eat even a scorpion, because the tasting of food by day in that
      time is forbidden by the Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ben-Abid struck on his door Sadok came forth, gibbering in his
      tangled beard, and half naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, brother!&rdquo; said Ben-Abid. &ldquo;Here is money if thou canst find me three
      scorpions. One of them must be a black scorpion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadok shot out his filthy claw, and there was fire in his eyes. But
      Ben-Abid&rsquo;s fingers closed round the money paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First thou must find the scorpions, and then thou must carry them with
      thee to the court of the dancers, walking at my side. For, as Allah lives,
      I will not touch them. Afterwards thou shalt have the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadok&rsquo;s soul drew the shutters across his eyes. Then he led the way by
      tortuous alleys to an old and ruined wall of a <i>zgag</i>, in which there
      were as many holes as there are in a honeycomb. Here, as he knew, the
      scorpions loved to sleep. Thrusting his fingers here and there he
      presently drew forth three writhing reptiles. And one of them was black.
      He held them out, with a cry, to Ben-Abid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money! The money!&rdquo; he shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ben-Abid shrank back, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must bring them to the dancers&rsquo; court. Hide them well in thy
      garments that none may see them. Then thou shalt have the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadok hid the scorpions upon his shaven head beneath his turban, and they
      went by the dunes and the lonely ways to the café of the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the pipers were playing, and many were assembled to see the women
      dance; but Ben-Abid and Sadok pushed through the throng, and passed across
      the café to the inner court, which is open to the air, and surrounded with
      earthen terraces on which, in tiers, open the rooms of the dancers, each
      with its own front door. This court is as a mighty rabbit warren, peopled
      with women instead of rabbits. Pale lights gleamed in many doorways, for
      the dancers were dressing and painting themselves for the dances of the
      body, of the hands, of the poignard, and of the handkerchief. Their shrill
      voices cried one to another, their heavy bracelets and necklets jingled,
      and the monstrous shadows of their crowned and feathered heads leaped and
      wavered on the yellow patches of light that lay before their doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Halima?&rdquo; cried Ben-Abid in a loud voice. &ldquo;Let Halima come forth
      and spit in my face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his call many women ran to their doors, some half dressed,
      some fully attired, like Jezebels of the great desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Ben-Abid!&rdquo; went up the cry of many voices. &ldquo;It is Ben-Abid, who
      laughs to scorn the power of the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot. It is the son of the
      camel with the swollen tongue. Halima, Halima, the child of the scorpion
      calls thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kouïdah, the boy, who was ever about, ran barefoot from the court into the
      café to tell of the doings of Ben-Abid, and in a moment the people crowded
      in, Zouaves and Spahis, Arabs and negroes, nomads from the south, gipsies,
      jugglers, and Jews. There were, too, some from Tamacine, and these were of
      all the most intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Halima?&rdquo; went up the cry. &ldquo;Where is Halima?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who calls me?&rdquo; exclaimed the voice of a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Halima came out of her door on the first terrace at the left,
      splendidly dressed for the dance in scarlet and gold, carrying two scarlet
      handkerchiefs in her hands, and with the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot dangling from her
      girdle of thin gold, studded with turquoises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben-Abid stood below in the court with Sadok by his side. The crowd
      pressed about him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast called me the son of a scorpion, Halima,&rdquo; he said, in a loud
      voice. &ldquo;Is it not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she answered, with a venomous smile of hatred. &ldquo;And thou
      hast said that the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot, blessed by the great marabout of
      Tamacine, would avail naught against the deadly sickness of a
      dancing-girl. Is it not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered Ben-Abid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a liar!&rdquo; cried Halima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so art thou!&rdquo; said Ben-Abid slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep murmur rose from the crowd, which pressed more closely beneath the
      terrace, staring up at the scarlet figure upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am a liar thou canst not prove it!&rdquo; cried Halima furiously. &ldquo;I spit
      upon thee! I spit upon thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she bent down her feathered head from the terrace and spat
      passionately in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben-Abid only laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prove that I have spoken the truth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if I am indeed
      the son of a scorpion, as thou sayest, let my brothers speak for me. Let
      my brothers declare to all the Sahara that the truth is in my mouth.
      Sadok, remove thy turban!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plunger of the wells, with a frantic gesture, lifted his turban and
      discovered the three scorpions writhing upon his shaven head. Another, and
      longer, murmur went up from the crowd. But some shrank back and trembled,
      for the desert Arabs are much afraid of scorpions, which cause many deaths
      in the Sahara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; cried Halima. &ldquo;How can the scorpions speak for thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall speak well,&rdquo; said Ben-Abid. &ldquo;Their voices cannot lie. Sleep
      to-night in thy room with these my brothers. Irena and Boria, the Golden
      Date and the Lotus Flower, shall watch beside thee. Guard in thy hand, or
      in thy breast, the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot that thou sayest can preserve from
      every ill. If, in the evening of to-morrow, thou dancest before the
      soldiers, I will give thee fifty golden coins. But, if thou dancest not,
      the city shall know whether Ben-Abid is a truth-teller, and whether the
      blessings of the great marabout can rest upon such a woman as thou art. If
      thou refusest thou art afraid, and thy fear proveth that thou hast no
      faith in the magic treasure that dangles at thy girdle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of deep silence. Then, from the crowd burst forth the
      cry of many voices:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it to the proof! Ben-Abid speaks well. Put it to the proof, and may
      Allah judge between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the caked pigments on her face Halima had gone pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cries rose up again, and with them the shrill, twittering laughter
      of her envious rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no faith in the marabout!&rdquo; squawked one, who had a nose like an
      eagle&rsquo;s beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a liar!&rdquo; piped another, shaking out her silken petticoats as a
      bird shakes out its plumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the twitter of fierce laughter rose, shriek on shriek, and was
      echoed more deeply by the crowd of watching men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the scorpions!&rdquo; cried Halima passionately. &ldquo;I am not afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her desert blood was up. Her fatalism&mdash;even in the women of the
      Sahara it lurks&mdash;was awake. In that moment she was ready to die, to
      silence the bitter laughter of her rivals. It sank away as Sadok grasped
      the scorpions in his filthy claw, and leaped, gibbering in his beard, upon
      the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Halima, as he came upon her, holding forth his handful of
      writhing poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom heaved. Her lustrous eyes, heavy with kohl, shone like those of
      a beast at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadok stood still, with his naked arm outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I know that the son of a scorpion will pay me the fifty golden
      coins? He is poor, though he speaks bravely. He is but a singer in the
      café of the smokers of the hashish, and cannot buy even a new garment for
      the close of the feast of Ramadan. How, then, shall I know that the gold
      will hang from my breasts when to-morrow, at the falling of the sun, I
      dance before the men of Toug&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben-Abid put his hand beneath his burnous, and brought forth a bag tied at
      the mouth with cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jews! He has been to the Jews!&rdquo; cried the desert men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a lamp!&rdquo; said Ben-Abid.

    <p>
      And while Irena and Boria, the Golden Date and the Lotus Flower, held the
      lights, and the desert men crowded about him with the eyes of wolves that
      are near to starving, he counted forth the money on the terrace at
      Halima&rsquo;s feet. And she gazed down at the glittering pieces as one that
      gazes upon a black fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now set my brothers upon the maiden,&rdquo; Ben-Abid said to Sadok,
      gathering up the money, and casting it again into the bag, which he tied
      once more with the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halima did not move, but she looked upon the scorpion that was black, and
      her red lips trembled. Then she closed her hand upon the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot
      that hung from her golden girdle, and shut her eyes beneath her ebon
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set my brothers upon her!&rdquo; said Ben-Abid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plunger of the wells sprang upon Halima, opened her scarlet bodice
      roughly, plunged his claw into her swelling bosom, and withdrew it&mdash;empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss her close, my brothers!&rdquo; whispered Ben-Abid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long murmur, like the growl of the tide upon a shingly beach, arose once
      more from the crowd. Halima turned about, and went slowly in at her
      lighted doorway, followed by Irena and Boria. The heavy door of palm was
      shut behind them. The light was hidden. There was a great silence. It was
      broken by Sadok&rsquo;s voice screaming in his beard to Ben-Abid, &ldquo;My money!
      Give me my money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched it with a howl, and went capering forth into the darkness.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When the next night fell upon the desert there was a great crowd assembled
      in the café of the dancers. The pipers blew into their pipes, and swayed
      upon their haunches, turning their glittering eyes to and fro to see what
      man had a mind to press a piece of money upon their well greased
      foreheads. The dancers came and went, promenading arm in arm upon the
      earthen floor, or leaping with hands outstretched and fingers fluttering.
      The Kabyle attendant slipped here and there with the coffee cups, and the
      wreaths of smoke curled lightly upward towards the wooden roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Halima came not through the open doorway holding the scarlet
      handkerchiefs above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently, late in the night, they laid her body in a palanquin, and
      set the palanquin upon a running camel, and, while the dancers shrilled
      their lament amid the sands, they bore her away into the darkness of the
      dunes towards the south and the tents of her own people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jackals laughed as she went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hedgehog&rsquo;s foot was left lying upon the floor of her chamber. Not
      one of the dancers would touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I was in the café, and, hearing of all these things from
      Kouïdah, the boy, I went into the court, and gathered up the trinket which
      had brought a woman to the great silence. Next day I rode on horseback to
      Tamacine, asked to see the marabout and told him all the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, smiling like the rising sun in an oleograph, and twisting in
      his huge hands, that were tinted with the henna, the staff with the
      apple-green ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to the end I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, holy marabout, tell me one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allah is just. I listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the scorpions had slept with a veiled woman who held the hedgehog&rsquo;s
      foot, how would it have been? Would the woman have died or lived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marabout did not answer. He looked at me calmly, as at a child who
      asks questions about the mysteries of life which only the old can
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;are hidden from the unbeliever. You
      are a Roumi. How, then, should you learn such matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even the Roumi&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the desert there are mysteries,&rdquo; continued the marabout, &ldquo;which even
      the faithful must not seek to penetrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is useless to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very useless. It is as useless as to try to count the grains of the
      sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mohammed El Aïd Ben Ali Tidjani smiled once more, and beckoned to a negro
      attendant, who ran with a musical box, one of the gifts of the faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This comes from Paris,&rdquo; he said, with a spreading complacence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was within the box a sounding click, and there stole forth a
      tinkling of Auber&rsquo;s music to <i>Masaniello</i>, &ldquo;Come o&rsquo;er the moonlit
      sea!&rdquo;
